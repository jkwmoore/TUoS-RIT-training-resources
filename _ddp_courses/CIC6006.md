description: "The C programming language is the language used to develop the UNIX operating system and is ideal for developing high performance applications. 
This hands on course provides an introduction to the C programming language and enables users to develop applications using that language. The course also considers advanced issues in C programming such as file handling, memory management, data structures, utilities for application development and using scientific libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK.

### Instructions

For this course we will use the University HPC training machine. To use the training machine you will need a basic knowledge of linux. Please see the RIT 101 course at: [Linux course](https://crs.shef.ac.uk/) **(Users must have the Sheffield VPN turned on.)**

Students may also use the cross platform integrated development environment known as codeblocks available from [Codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/).

The course has a series of different case studies which you can download and run.
