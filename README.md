# Research IT - Training Resources Website

##  What is this site?

This is a website to organise / allow filtering of training resources and provide a useful index for researchers and students at the University of Sheffield. Provided by Research IT from IT Services @TUoS.

## How to modify the generated website

* To add training links please look at the ``_data/links`` folder, each YAML file in this folder will be parsed. Ensure the same structure from the ``test_links.yaml`` is used..
* To change the external links (i.e. those in the footer) please edit the ``_data/externalWebsiteLinks.yml`` file.
* Adjustments to the theme / page can be made by editing both ``_layouts/default.html`` and  ``_sass/jekyll-theme-cayman-red.scss ``
* Please add assets such as CSS, JS or images in the appropriate subdirectory of ``assets``.
* Other configuration files control aspects of the Jekyll generation of pages e.g.  ``_config.yml``,  ``_data/pages.yml``, ``training.md`` and files in the ``_sass`` folder.

-----

## How to build the website

* Install Jekyll - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

On Ubuntu this looks like:

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
gem install jekyll bundler
```

* Install the dependencies / theme:

```
bundle install
```

* Have Jekyll autobuild as you make changes:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```

* Open the site in your favorite browser
